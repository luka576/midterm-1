1. The general problems associated with me writing code was mostly not being pracctically familiar with the key points of how java works
in particular, I had problems in the 2nd task, which mostly delved on the fact that I could not put the code that was in the URL into IntelliJ
which made me copy the code in the created class, instead of just editing it. 
Same unawareness happened when I had to create a subpackage,however, that was eaily solved, 
still after that I assume I was not able to fulfill the objectives as said, in a theory I know how to
print or import, but even with the help of AI it was hard to actually solve the mini problems it created for me.
Task 3 is a prime example for that, while it was relatively easier to create the almost same thing as in the file, I am not sure if my code works as fine as it should.


2. AI helped me in its own way, it did help me learn something new such as javaDoc, even though I am not sure whether I did that correctly
or not, I got the idea about it. It was most useful in the third task, because it gave me the exact variable\class names I should use as names
for better coordination, but it did not provide the explanation as to why some of the features did not work, in the second task I used it for the
second request which meant to print the area of the rectangle, as mentioned before the correctness of it may be less than expected.

3. I suppose the hardest thing for AI to do is to be in the same place as I am, for example in IntelliJ to create packages and classes
I just got the theoretical idea as to how to do it, which was enough, however without prior knowledge AI is almost useless in that manner.
